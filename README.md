   <h1>Cyber Cobra</h1>
  <h2> Overview</h2>
<p>We are a game studio that makes side scroller games that are like games like Megaman and Metroid.However we are planning to make 3D games in the future. We’re a small company with three workers which are us. We make games and then sell them to other companies. This company was created because we love games, so over the years we learned how to make them and then we made the studio. We are still trying to expand,though like  in the number of games and employees due to the slow process of making our games. </p>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The studio was made so people would have a fun gaming experience that helps them relax.
Our games are based off of older games and have a retro, but modern look. The games are also very different in things like characters,maps etc…….
Soon, as our funds and supplies grow, we will start creating other genres and types of games. We also want to make games available to consoles to get more popularity.

Another thing we plan to do is partner up with bigger companies to gain popularity, profit and to increase our production.

We plan to get more employees which will be done by holding contests. </p>
<h2>Marketing Strategy</h2>
<p>We have made a page at Kickstarter to help us become more known by sharing game designs we are making.
Not only does the page help our popularity, users can donate to us, helping us get money for our games which is used for improving or making new ones.
Another plan is to make our games simple, yet good looking. This may help achieve popularity and our games may be available in places such as game stores and online stores such as Steam.
